The reef is famous among surfers for its powerful waves and popularity with sharks. I thought I was dreaming; everything seemed to slow down. I think the shark was confused because it stared back at me for a few moments as if in awe. It bolted past me and I felt a shove from behind – it must have brushed along my back, but thankfully it had not bitten me. After it passed, I swam to the surface as fast as I could. When I got there, I saw my surfboard lying in front of me with a bite mark on it. The reef is off the coast of the Eastern Cape, where most fatal shark attacks happen in Africa, and I had heard the stories: sharks going back for a second and third time to finish a surfer off. As told to Jack DuttonDo you have an experience to share?',

 {'summary': 'Returns as of 8/29/2021Returns as of 8/29/2021Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. We also discuss 2015 allegations about Amazon\'s toxic workplace culture. We\'re heading back to 2015 when Morgan Housel, then Fool writer, now, New York Times best-selling author, joined us to talk about behavioral finances and biases that could be sabotaging your money. All that and more, on this week\'s episode of Motley Fool Answers. The New York Times took Amazon to the woodshed over their corporate culture recently in an article. Lord of the Flies because I saw it in Florida. The point is, I think for any company you could find 100 people who have some sad tales to tell. Now, as you hinted at though, Amazon has already been in the news over the years for working conditions. If you want to be a great company, you actually have to act like this. One of my favorite lines was when some Amazon employee or executive pointed toward Microsoft and said, "We don\'t want to run a country club." Because they have all that nice stuff that you hear about at Google [Alphabet] and those companies and I am to say there\'s a part of me that agrees with that. I mean, The Motley Fool bleeds its culture and we have lots of perks too and every once in a while, I think we, as a company, need to provide that, but it comes from a good place, so to speak, and that is many of our investors here believe that the culture of a company is reflected on how successful the company becomes and thus the stock price. But because of the company environment, the flexibility, something like that, is worth it. That makes me sound like such a bad person. [...]Today, we have Morgan Housel joining us. I think for decades and decades, almost essentially finance was taught as purely a math based subject. Most of that is just acknowledging and understanding the behavioral biases that everyone falls for. Brokamp: I hope this has to do with Nightmare on Elm Street. Southwick: Because it is easy to forget, especially in the market that we\'ve been in, it\'s easy to forget that, well, I don\'t need to compare myself to the benchmark of the S&P. Look how awesome I\'m doing. Southwick: But right now, it\'s like grizzly bear attacks. Housel: For a lot of that though, if you look at the data, it\'s not that there\'s more occurrences, it\'s just that we start paying attention to it more often. The next one we have is the curse of knowledge. Where we also see it a lot is with economic professors, who a lot of their theories in their models are based on this idea that all consumers will act rationally, and are perfectly informed. Whereas actually, it turns out we\'re mostly emotional. Housel: I hate it for a couple of reasons. Brokamp: The lesson is being ADD, that is the secret. The endowment funds said, "Our goals are generational. It\'s because the investors are focusing on the quarter. Southwick: Which at The Motley Fool, as long-term investors, our goals are way down the road at least three to five years. Southwick: The last one we\'re going to talk about is the bias bias. I think that\'s what the bias is thinking when you\'re reading out behavioral psychology, behavioral finance, and all the mistakes people make. You think it\'s something that applies to someone else, and not yourself. They read about extreme discounting, and frequency illusion. I will never do that, but almost everyone does. Brokamp: You think you\'re better than everyone else. Because I think if people thought that about themselves, they\'d have a hard time making it through the day. Southwick: Existential eggs of Morgan Housel. Brokamp: I\'ve done enough with money as much as Alison will know. Is there maybe a book they can read or what do you think would be most helpful for our people?Housel: Daniel Kahneman\'s book, Thinking, Fast and Slow, is the combination of his life\'s work. He uses that as an example of financial advisors not understanding the human element of risk-taking. Housel: You know what\'s crazy about that? Southwick: If that makes you feel better. We have received a ton of mail from you guys, which is awesome. He writes, "In my IRA accounts, I have funds from Vanguard, Amana, Royce, T. Rowe Price, Baron, Hennessy. Some funds I have kept for 15-20 years, others are relatively new additions. I was wondering if you can provide some suggestions and tips on deciding when to sell a fund. You want below average expenses then look at performance. Morningstar will also, on the expenses, give a fee level. It will say low, below average, average high to do that. Do you have any soothing thoughts to help me take the plunge?"Brokamp: Well, it\'s a great question. It depends on the tax bite because let\'s say you have $10,000 in a fund. You actually can choose which of those portions to sell. Otherwise, there is a default when you tell them to sell, and they\'re going to choose the shares that you sold them and they may not be the best ones to sell from a tax perspective.',
